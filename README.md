# concrete-php-assert
A concrete class that extends PHPUnit\Framework\Assert so that it can be instantiated as a class and used as an object.

If you just want a short name for that class you could `use` the short version of the name.

See: [Using namespaces: Aliasing/Importing](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.importing.php)

```php
use PHPUnit\Framework\Assert as Assert;
```

Is the same as:

```php
use PHPUnit\Framework\Assert as Assert;
```
